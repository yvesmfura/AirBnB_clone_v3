## Environment
This project thrives in the rich ecosystem of Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, orchestrated seamlessly by the graceful movements of Python3 (version 3.4.3).

## Installation
To embark on this journey:
- Dive into the interactive world with `./console` and let your commands dance with joy.
- Or, explore the depths of automation with `echo "<command>" | ./console.py`.

## File Descriptions
Behold the pillars of our kingdom:
- `console.py`: The guardian of commands, guiding your every interaction.
- `models/`: The sanctuary of classes, where every entity finds its place.
- `models/engine/`: The heart of our engine, orchestrating the magic of serialization and deserialization.
- `/tests`: The arena of warriors, where every line of code is tested and fortified.

## Usage
Embark on a journey of discovery:
- Create, show, update, or destroy instances with the ease of a whisper.

## Examples of Use
- Create a new instance:
    ```
    create BaseModel
    ```

- Show an instance:
    ```
    show BaseModel 1234-5678-9012
    ```

- Update an instance:
    ```
    update BaseModel 1234-5678-9012 name "New Name"
    ```
